# Graduate Data Visualization: RShiny Housing Market Application
Project group only consisted of me [Mateo Forero]. The original project was done in R.

To see code output, refer to the [.MD file](Stroke_Data-Mining.md).

## Project Overview
This was a project for the graduate course Data Visualization. It allows for interactive plots using reactive R language to compare the housing market in the last decade for each state. The motivation for this dashboard was to give an overview of each states housing market that a novice user can understand. The user can select the state they are interested in looking at and use the date slider to zoom in to specific time ranges. This trend shows how different residential properties have increased in value over the last 10 years. Redfin collects the data in a per month bases (i.e median sale price for Jan-2019).
